Professional Experience
'''''''''''''''''''''''
- UC Santa Cruz Mechatronics

	We developed the mechanical and electronic hardware; and event driven
	software, necessary to complete a series of tasks within a variable
	environment. Highlights include: 

	- Using motion profiling for complex maneuvering
	- Feedback control for line following  
	- Identifying signal peaks using a real-time derivative 
	- Developing signal conditioning and power distribution circuits. 

- NASA JPL Summer, Pasadena CA (January-June 2015)

	Worked in the Autonomous Systems Division under the Small Scale Flight
	Software group. Work was performed within the open source, model based NASA 
	JPL FPrime flight software framework.

	Worked involved: 
		- Full design cycle to rebuild the a ground support server using
		  Python ZeroMQ middleware  
		- Designing the architecture supporting a dynamic, many-many,
		  ‘publish-subscribe’ distributed system 
		- Designing ‘pluggable’ inline packet protocol translation 
		- Developing an embedded C++ ‘ZmqRadio’ component enabling robust
		  communication between embedded systems and the new server. 


- NASA JPL Summer, Pasadena CA (January-June 2015) 

	Worked in the Autonomous Systems Division under the Small Scale Flight
	Software group. Work was performed within the open source, model based NASA
	JPL FPrime flight software framework.

	Worked involved: 
		- Developed bug fixes and enhancements
		- Implemented GSE application state persistence
		- Created a real-time telemetry visualization display handling
		  multiple telemetry channels
		- Created a UI and API for spacecraft file uplink and downlink
		  utilizing cFDP like packets. 
		- Created a general a F-Prime file packet editor that eases creation
		  of packet payloads. 
		- Created a C++ signal generator component for telemetry
		  visualization testing.

- NASA JPL Summer, Pasadena CA (June-September 2015)

	Worked in the Autonomous Systems Division under the Small Scale Flight
	Software group. Work was performed within the open source, model based NASA 
	JPL FPrime flight software framework.

	Worked involved: 

		- Writing a multi-level testing suite that tested C++ code generation , 
		  configuration file parsing, C++ building and runtime performance.  
		- Refactored a portion of the code generator to fix a design inconsistency 
		- Created a Python wrapper that runs legacy C code to perform 
		  batched Allan Variance calculations.

- Running Warehouse, San Luis Obispo CA (January-June 2015)

	Worked with the image processing division to create a web application that
	automated a manual employee process. Primary work done with the PHP backend 
	to support MySQL operations.
